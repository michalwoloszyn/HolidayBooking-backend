# AirBnb2.0 - holiday booking app

Back end of the app hosted on railway.com (live demo version)

## Demo

https://holidaybooking.netlify.app/ (CURRENTLY NOT LIVE DUE TO ONGOING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HOSTING)

Uploading photos feature doesn't work because photos are being retrieved from github. Uploading them would cause build and deployment process restart thus I deleted this function from live demo. The feature is fully working locally.
