# AirBnb2.0 - holiday booking app

Back end of the app hosted on railway.com used for live demo version

## Demo

https://holidaybooking.netlify.app/

Uploading photos feature doesn't work because photos are being retrieved from github. Uploading them would cause build and deployment process restart thus I deleted this function from live demo. It's fully working locally.
